Yet Another LitElement Generator

There was a namechange. As the application generates components and template apps based on the litLement library from
Polymerjs™ project, it would be more appropriate to rename it. 

# What is yaleg
As the name implies, this tool is meant to be a cli quick project generator using the litElement library from Google™
á la angular-cli from the angular team.

# General Usage
It is recommended to compile the source before first time usage.
